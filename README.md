Here, we analyzed the infection demographics and population structure of West Nile Virus in California. Our project has 4 aims:
1) Identify the species composition of both bird and mosquito vector species and sampling localities
2) Create an interactive map that looks at infection rates across the state in relation to proximity to water and locality
3) Conduct hierarchical cluster analysis to look at viral strain diversity by vector species
4) Determine the population structure by distance using Principal Components Analysis
